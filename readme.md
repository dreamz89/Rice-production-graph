Responsive line chart example

Using the data in the CSV provided (named milledRiceEndingStocks.csv), create a responsive line chart using HTML, CSS, JS (ok jQuery) and d3.js (the latest version, no others charts libraries).

Try to replicate the example, shown in the video here, as close as possible. A few things to note:

●	The chart shows every five years on the X-axis, also note some labels will auto-hide at very small widths \
●	It allows the user to click on the legend to show/hide each line, note this will also affect the Y-axis scale \
●	When user hovers over the line chart, it shows the value with the year on the right hand side in desktop, and apply a tooltip for mobile \
●	Legend moves above chart for mobile \
●	Resizes the chart smoothly with an animation both as window changes and when hiding/showing the lines
